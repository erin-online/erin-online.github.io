Forward progress will happen at some point.
Similarity Similarity, as it relates to art’s creation, manifests as a sort of constraining or binding force, usually due to demands from people viewing the art. For an example, let’s take the production of a continuously-running TV show. The following similarities may be imposed on it:
New work must take the form of a high-quality video with a specific runtime.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/writings/the_art_difference_the_environment/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://erin-online.github.io/writings/lain_machine_learning/>Serial Experiments Lain - Machine Learning Edition (Repost and Commentary)</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2024-01-20</span></div><div class=post-content>Introduction This is a repost of something I posted on xenofem.me here on September 13, 2022. I now feel like I have more perspective on the topics I brought up, so I’ve written some commentary for it.
Serial Experiments Lain: Machine Learning Edition a sociable girl stumbles across an ai art generator on the internet and is mystified by it. she picks out the outputs she likes the best, sets her desktop background to one of them, prints out two more and puts them on the wall of her room.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/writings/lain_machine_learning/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://erin-online.github.io/writings/beyond_deduction_and_induction/>Beyond Deduction and Induction</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2023-10-23</span></div><div class=post-content>Status Report I was hoping to speed up my rate of completion on projects, but this has proven to be a harder task than it looks. In this case, the actual programming process is only a small part of it–the real difficulty lies in logically defining the problem, so that I can actually start on the programming. This post will show off the progress I’ve made so far on that front.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/writings/beyond_deduction_and_induction/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://erin-online.github.io/writings/atb_and_the_minecraft_problem/>A Thousand Brains and the Minecraft Problem</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2022-11-07</span></div><div class=post-content>Introduction What follows is a series of notes on the book A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence, written by Jeff Hawkins, henceforth abbreviated as ATB. I read this book because some random person in YouTube comments recommended it, and because it was actually readily available at my local library, unlike Neuromancer, which I’m still waiting for.
ATB’s concepts can be taken in many different directions, and the other parts of this post are dedicated to just that: exploring potential implications and synthesizing ATB with other texts.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/writings/atb_and_the_minecraft_problem/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://erin-online.github.io/writings/know_your_enemy/>Know Your Enemy</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2022-08-03</span></div><div class=post-content>Mini Progress Update Before I get into the post for today, I want to share how things have been going since the conclusion of my first project:
I’ve been working with Common Lisp and it’s been good to me so far. When I said I wanted a language that encouraged me to get groundwork in place, my only frame of reference was object-oriented stuff like Java. I still think OOP is neat, but Lisp’s interactive REPL is great as well to help me work through bugs.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/writings/know_your_enemy/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2024 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
