hello, i'm erin! i've been around since 2001, 2014, or 2021, depending on who you ask. you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/cityposting), [pleroma](https://social.xenofem.me/erin), and discord (city#0310).

for pretty much my whole life, i've invested lots of my free time into various competitive games. rather than dismiss them as a waste of time, i want to use my unique perspective to make advances in artifical intelligence.

i am not currently in need of money and have no plans to turn this series of projects into anything resembling a job. however, i am generally in need of employment, so if you want to support me, contact me through one of the above avenues with remote job offers that would be a good fit for me. thanks!
