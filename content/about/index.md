hello, i'm erin! i've been around since 2001, 2014, or 2021, depending on who you ask. you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/cityposting), [pleroma](https://social.xenofem.me/erin), and discord (cityposting).

i've come up with various reasons as to why i'm doing these projects over the years. a while ago i wrote a draft on how i thought ai research needed to be liberated from academia and placed into the hands of the common people (which is kinda the goal of this blog), but i really didn't like how it turned out so i haven't published it yet. maybe it will live here in the future.

i've made various pieces of art, mostly silly amateur paint.net drawings, and don't really consider myself an artist. i might compile all my art here one day, but i feel like most people aren't really here for that stuff.

i am not currently in need of money and have no plans to turn this series of projects into anything resembling a job. however, i am generally in need of employment, so if you want to support me, contact me through one of the above avenues with remote job offers that would be a good fit for me. thanks!
